# Kanban Task Board

The aim of the project was to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. The app featured dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I also used bootstrap and Day.js.

## Completed Issues
 * Display lists of project tasks in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).

 * Colour code  to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red).

 * Create a new modal task and enter the title, description and deadline date.

 * When save button is clicked for the task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.

 * Allows the task to be dragged to a different progress column drag a task to a different progress column. Then the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
 
 * The delete button for each task will remove the task from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing.

 * The saved task will persist after refreshing the page


## Bugs Fixed

* Task displayed on task board but were not draggable

## Current Bugs

* inconsistent colour change on the 'Done' column.
